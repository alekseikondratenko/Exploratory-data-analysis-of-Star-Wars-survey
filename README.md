# Exploratory-data-analysis-of-Star-Wars-survey
This is a project to showcase my data visualization skills. The survey of Star Wars fans has been used as a dataset. The goal was to perform data cleaning and then analyze and visualize the data in order to understand which movie of the Star Wars saga is the most popular and highest rated among different groups of survey participants. Python visualization libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn have been used for static graphs and Plotly has been used for interactive ones. Unfortunately, since GitHub cannot show interactive graphs from Plotly they are shown as static "png" pictures.
